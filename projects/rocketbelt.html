 <h1>Rocketbelt Pattern Library</h1>
 <p class="situation">For years the company exercised limited governance over UI quality of the site. The development team’s level of comfort with non-trivial CSS varied greatly; over time this led to styles that were unnecessarily repeated or replaced. This resulted in wildly inconsistent results as well as a much larger-than-necessary CSS payload. For example, our CSS had declared 32 different shades of blue, and 113 different font sizes.</p>
 <p class="tasks">We knew we needed to enforce better consistency of our UI components, and that this would in turn benefit the consistency of the overall shopping experience. A pattern library would also provide a boost to developers who were less familiar with CSS so we could leverage their strengths in other areas. We also knew that accessibility needed to be built into all of our patterns with as little configuration at development time as possible.</p>
 <p class="actions">I surveyed our site to build a list of components we’d need right off the bat, as well as those we’d be better off replacing. Next, I dove deep into existing pattern libraries to spark discussion and ideas with my teammates. After we had a minimally viable list of patterns, I fleshed them out in HTML, Sass, and Javascript. As our initial set of patterns neared completion, I collaborated with a wide group of developers to ensure this new pattern library was easy to understand and would be easy for them to put into practice.</p>
