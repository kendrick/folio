 <h1>Checkout</h1>
 <p class="situation">Our checkout experience represented to company poorly at a critical point in the shopping process: converting a browser to a buyer. In addition to overall inconsistency within the interface, necessary actions were unclear, superfluous UI & copy increased distraction, and the experience wasn’t accessible to customers using assistive technology. We knew we could do better, and that improving the customer’s experience in checkout would make a positive impact to the bottom line.</p>
 <p class="tasks">With the goal of making checkout easier for a customer to complete, I made a plan to improve the information architecture of the experience. Additionally, I needed to increase its consistency with the rest of the site, as well as with other familiar ecommerce sites.</p>
 <p class="actions">I sketched & explored options for simplifying the presentation of shipping methods. I made high fidelity comps of this alternate design, but ultimately didn’t receive the necessary development resources to implement that approach. Instead, I simplified repetitive interactions such as adding personal information, or selecting a billing address for a credit card. This effort was greatly reduced by leveraging the company’s pattern library and by mentoring a young development team in some advanced front-end techniques.</p>
 <p class="results">The result is a consistent experience that focuses on ease &amp; speed of task completion. The redesign will launch before mid-February. I’ll a/b test as many aspects of the new design as possible, and expect to see faster cart completion with an accompanying lift in conversion rate.</p>
